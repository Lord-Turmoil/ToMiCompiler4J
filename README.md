This project is built with negative feelings, thus there is few comments in it.

Java is a good language, but not an elegant one. Unifying everything with object turns out to dumb and clumsy. On the contrary, although we have to manually manage our memory in C++, it provides us all the possibility of doing everything.

With Java, you can build a fully-functional skyscraper, but of an ordinary look. However, with C++, although some extra efforts required, truly splendid and magnificent you're able to construct.
